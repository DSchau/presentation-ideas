# React from an angular dev's perspective

## Overall thoughts

- I'd start with React if I were writing a new, personal project
- I love how React is unopinionated about a lot of things, and lets you choose your own stack
 - Some may dislike this; for them -> Angular
- Redux/flux architecture can be a bit daunting, but it solves a real problem
 - Think of it like a central data store that dispatches events/data to child components
